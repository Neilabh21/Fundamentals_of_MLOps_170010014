### Part I
#### 1. In the notes of Week 1, we compared & contrasted MLOps with DevOps. In this question, you need to understand what is meant by the term AIOps, & then contrast it with MLOps.


#### 2. Interpretable Machine Learning is another concept that has attracted lot of attention recently & is promoted by most of the MLOps frameworks. Explain what it means for a linear regression model to be interpretable. 


#### 3. What is AutoML? How is it related to MLOps? Just as we saw a list of various MLOps tools, create a list of 3-5 tools used for AutoML (& try to explore their functionality by reading their docs).
